In order\n  to explore as many model structures as possible, I'm developing this tools which\n  are generic enough to be used in any individual-based model for any infectious disease.\n  At this moment, the package has 2 generic functions.\n  \n## 1. Create a synthetic population having several states.\n  This function populates a matrix in which columns represent the states of the \n  individuals and rows represent the individuals. Making it a generic function\n  will let you explore as many disease state as you want. This is expecially \n  useful when you're comparing your IBM with your ODE model.\n  \n  \n```{r}\nlibrary(ibmcraftr)\nsyn_pop(c(3,2,1)) # will populate 3 individuals in state 1, 2 in state 2 and 1 in state 3.\n```\n  \n## 2. Make state transitions.\n  Using the state matrix of a population created previously, calculate the transitions \n  from one state to other state(s) using the transition rate(s).\n  \n```{r}\npop <- syn_pop(c(19,1,0,0))\nstate_trans(1,2,.1,pop) #state transition from 1 to 2, at rate .1\nstate_trans(1,4,100,pop) #state transition from 1 to 4, at rate 100\n```\n\n",
